function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
	%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
	%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
	%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
	%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
	%   working with learning algorithms.
	% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
	% Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
	%               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
	%               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the 
	%               standard deviation of each feature and divide
	%               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
	%               the standard deviation in sigma. 
	%
	%               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a 
	%               feature and each row is an example. You need 
	%               to perform the normalization separately for 
	%               each feature. 
	%
	% Hint: You might find the 'mean' and 'std' functions useful.
	%       
	% ============================================================
	% You need to set these values correctly
	X_norm = X;
	mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
	sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
	numberOfColumnsInX_norm = columns(X_norm);
	% works with input matrix X of any size
	for i = 1:numberOfColumnsInX_norm, 
		meanOfCurrentFeatureInX = mean(X(:, i));
		mu(:, i) = meanOfCurrentFeatureInX;

		X_norm(:, i) = X_norm(:, i) .- mu(:, i);

		standardDeviationOfCurrentFeatureInX = std(X(:, i));
		sigma(:, i) = standardDeviationOfCurrentFeatureInX;

		X_norm(:, i) = X_norm(:, i) ./ sigma(:, i);
